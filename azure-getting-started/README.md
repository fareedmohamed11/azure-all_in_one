## Getting Started with Azure ðŸš€

This area constitutes all the resources for getting started with Azure. It similarly includes the full list of Microsoft Documentation and links to the videos related to the subjects. I recommend starting with the OpenEdx course below as it is free and provides a certificate if you pass the exam.

### Microsoft Links ðŸ”—

* [Microsoft Azure Homepage](https://azure.microsoft.com/) - Visit Microsoft's web page describing the services they provide in Azure.
* [Microsoft Azure Free Trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) - Create a free trial for 30 days. You will use your credit card for verification but you will not be charged for the products after the period ends.
* [Microsoft Azure Price Calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator/) - Microsoft created a pricing calculator to help you understand the pricing. Because the platform contains so many products, it is hard to understand the pricing. This tool will make it easier to understand the pricing of the different products.
